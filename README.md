 * Initial Ethereum networks for emission: Testnet, then Mainnet
 * Investments to extend R&D and software developers team are welcome!
 * Competing & integrated & collaborating projects: https://golem.network/ & https://iex.ec/ ; maybe others, too, as research progresses.
 * Initial planned IoT platform: Android
 * Initial planned way to implement user devices platform for executing semi-arbitrary code: a fast optimized custom low-level VM to interact with low-level Android OS internals to make the user experience seamless and friction-free
 * Head cloud interacts with IoT devices VMs
 * 5% of IoT devices VMs tokens income would go to the project RWS DAO stakeholders

## SvelteKit

Example project using SvelteKit with the [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/), deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

### Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsveltekit&project-name=sveltekit-vercel&repository-name=sveltekit-vercel&demo-title=SvelteKit%20%2B%20Vercel&demo-description=SvelteKit%20app%20fetching%20data%20from%20the%20SpaceX%20GraphQL%20API.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fsveltekit.examples.vercel.com%2F&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fsveltekit.examples.vercel.com%2Ftwitter.png)

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

This uses the [Vercel Adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel) for SvelteKit.

```bash
npm run build
```
